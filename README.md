## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned
I reinforced my knowled on the<span> tag in HTML and the use of flexbox in CSS


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<span style="color:hsl(224, 30%, 27%); text-align: right; position: relative; left: 20px;">80</span>
<span style="color:hsla(224, 30%, 27%, 0.6); text-align: right;"> /100</span>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development
I'm aware my code is not DRY and I need to learn to make my code neat.
I want to reinforce my knowledge of css especially when it comes to positions and transformation.


### Useful resources
